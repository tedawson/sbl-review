# Lisa Blasch, Daniel Pfurtscheller, Thomas Schröder, eds. *Schneller,  bunter, leichter? Kommunikationsstile im medialen Wandel* Innsbrucker Beiträge zur Kulturwissenschaft, Germanistische Reihe 88. Innsbruck: Innsbruck UP, 2018. 369 pp.

A volume addressing the changes wrought in communicative style by changes in the media landscape has an obvious urgency today. Based on contributions to a conference held in Innsbruck in February 2016--four months before the Brexit referendum, nine months before Donald Trump's election, and more than a year before the elections which would see the installation of a new Austrian black-blue coalition--the various chapters were conceived before many of the prominent markers of an ascendant right-wing populism which popular press and academic observers alike have sought to connect to media upheaval. The essays assembled here offer careful documentation and contextualization of these trends that have recently exploded into mainstream discourse.

Schröder's introductory essay "Medienkommunikation im Wandel" provides a framework for the volume, introducing three rubrics of medial change, or "Metatrends des Medienwandels:" the changing relationship of word and image (*Bilderflut*); the increasingly active role of the recipient; and the problematic results of a shift towards the wishes of that recipient (*Boulevardisierung*) (13). While all of these changes might be associated with the rise of the world wide web, Schröder traces their origins to the mid-1980s, showing how newspaper and television had already begun to demonstrate these trends before the web would radicalize them. While it is disappointing that the essay does not mention radio--a medium which would perhaps complicate its arguments--its value lies in the care given to tracing large scale trends across media, showing for instance how the shifts in newspaper formats towards short teasers on the front page or the rise after the 1984-85 allowance of private channels in Germany of the remote-control wielding television viewer represent a more active recipient in ways that anticipate the web user.

After this introductory chapter, the book is divided into three sections, although the heterogeneity of the chapters within each belies somewhat the organization. The first section, "Metatrends des Wandels" already explodes both any organizational framework suggested by the table of contents as well as any guiding sense given by Schröders essay. Where Schröder had offered an already intriguing time framework by tracing present trends to 1980s, for example two essays explode this frame. First, Michael Klemm's engaging discussion of *Jahresrückblicke* as medial figures of memory (Assman) stretches across the history of these programs in the ARD, which, with a two year hiatus from 2012-2013, reaches from 1952 to the present, [as he works through decade by decade... showing continual change, without some sort of 80s acceleration?]. Klemm, who has previously compared year-in-review programs across cultures here turns to change over time, ["eine kleine multimodale Kultur- und Diskursgeschichte der Bundesrepublik" (53)]

Konstantin Niehaus's chapter, which discusses language and style in German-language newspapers of the 18th and 19th centuries explodes the time scale still further. Like Lisa Blasch's chapter which follows, it challenges the simplification of a concept like *Boulevardisierung*. Niehaus thus challenges ideas about an increasingly colloquialized and therefore dumb-down language in post war newspapers, pointing out the lacking basis for the claim that older newspapers had not featured such language and taking first steps towards a serious investigation of the use of language of distance and language of immediacy in older papers. Blasch discusses the prevalence of human interest stories and celebrity narratives in contemporary media, two aspects of an oft-bemoaned *Boulevardisierung*, drawing on John Fiske's concept of the hyperreal figure to suggest that such "*hyperreal[e] Medienfiguren" might function as "textuelle Schauplätze öffentlicher Debatten" (112), bringing her position closer to that of a Robin Lakoff (cf *The Language War*) in recognizing such texts as not a trivialization or avoidance of important matters, but rather a means of debating them.

The section features an equally wide range of methodologies, from applied linguistics in Aleksandra Gnach's chapter on virtual communities (one line discussion) to ...

Particularly interesting is opener, narrative, taken back up in Blasch

"Hinter diesem machtvollen Narrativ, das vorherrschende Gefühle  aufgreift, verschwinden die Fakten. Sie werden vom Publikum nur aufgenommen und erhalten ihre Bedeutung, soweit sie in das dominante Narrativ passen" (45)
"wie maechtig ein dominantes Narrativ die oeffentliche Debatte bestimmen kann" (48) --narrative as prison
-turn towards demands for journalistic training
"Wird ein Narrativ erkannt, benannt und beschrieben, ist es eher moeglich, sich seiner Deutungsmacht zu entziehen und anderes zu denken" (49)


The second section, "Formate," is by far the largest, with seven essays. As before, it is not entirely clear why these essays belong together. Daniel Pfurtscheller's essay investigating the changes in the kid's quiz show "1, 2 oder 3" over 40 years shares much in common Klemm's discussion of Jahresrückblicke, even if the theoretical framework is different. Similarly, Martha Kuhnhenn's analysis of the glyphosate debates is similar in its handling of contemporary controversies to Herrmann's  chapter on reporting on refugee's and crime, down to its focus on a small facet of the larger discourse, though Kuhnhenn's discussion of faq's... Herrmann's of reporting on ARD...
Three chapters handle online news: Tanjev Schultz investigates the "teaser" in digital news stories, marking out interesting trends like the "Von-Wegen-Teaser" (Alle Teaser sind originell? Von wegen" (199)) and showing how teasers can serve to guide users to more sophisticated content, but also contribute to a sensationalism in news reporting. Karl N. Renner's chapter handles the same object as Cordelia Wolf and Alexander Godulla's collaboration: multimedia long-form journalism. Indeed, both contributions start out with the *New York Times's* Pulitzer-prize winning "Snow Fall," and in spite of their rather different methodologies--Renner surveys different examples through the lens of communicative action, while Wolf and Godulla present an empirical analysis of reception--between their shared theme and similar cautious optimism: "Interaktive multimediale Online-Reportagen bieten optimale Voraussetzungen, den Journalismus bei der Wahrnehmung seiner gesellschaftlichen Aufgaben zu unterstützen" (Renner 147), they present highly congruent studies, and the reader might regret that it was not a three-person collaboration. The remaining two chapters from this section cross historical periods. Sylvia Jaki analyzes two English TV documentaries about Jack the Ripper using Spitzmüller and Warnke's *diskurslinguistische Mehr-Ebenen-Analyse*. Heike Ortner's analysis of language and media change in fitness instructions begins with quotations from 1913 and 2015, noting the obvious shift from "Leibesübungen als Maßnahme zur Stärkung des 'Volkskörpers'" to exercise "als Weg zu Fitness, Schlankheit und Attraktivität im Interesse höheren persönlichen Wohlbefindens" (250). But the focus of her engaging essay is not the ideological shifts found in fitness instructions, but rather the shifts in language and media, discovering an (unsurprising) increase in imagery and decrease in text, alongside an increased normalization and standardization of fitness language (drawn from the US) in newer texts.

The first two chapters of the third section fit well with its title, "Partizipative Potenziale," as both explore comments in online news sites. Dennis Kaltwasser and Marianne Franz draw distinctions between such commentary and social media postings, as well as more traditional letters to the editor--in the latter case, Kaltwasser is especially thorough. Franz's contribution will be of particular interest to Austriannists, because her examples are drawn from postings on the websites of *Der Standard* and *Die Krone* involving the notorious "bauliche Maßnahmen" during the height of the refugee crisis in 2015. Andreas Wiesinger's contribution also addresses online comments, specifically on the sites of German tabloids, and unlike the previous two chapters which had distinguished between such comments on social media, he draws out the connections to Facebook and Twitter, addressing these two platforms more directly than any previous chapter. The final chapter is something of an outlier: Heiner Apel, Bernadette Rieder, and Cordula Schwarze take us to the Raetermuseum Hohe Birga near Innsbruck and analyze the tension between "Medien als Dienst am Exponat" and "Medien als Exponat" (360), a discussion which provides insight relevant to earlier essays as well, since media are never just the newspapers and websites we read, but are also an object of these. This final essay expands and qualifies the volume in other ways as well, because it for the first time raises questions of media interactions that are not only visual and auditory, but also olfactory and haptic, and because the museum example seems to contradict at least part of the assumption underlying the volumes title, for while *bunter* and *leichter* may accurately describe the media of the museum, museum texts depend on strategies of "Verlangsamung, der Einladung zum Verweilen sowie zur Vertiefung" (332).

Inspite of the somewhat arbitrary organization and the sorts of variations and inconsistencies that one often finds in such volumes, the essays presented here are highly engaging takes on different aspects of a very timely theme, and the volume is a welcome contribution to media studies scholarship.
