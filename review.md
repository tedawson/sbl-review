# Lisa Blasch, Daniel Pfurtscheller, Thomas Schröder, eds. *Schneller,  bunter, leichter? Kommunikationsstile im medialen Wandel* Innsbrucker Beiträge zur Kulturwissenschaft, Germanistische Reihe 88. Innsbruck: Innsbruck UP, 2018. 369 pp.

A volume addressing the changes wrought in communicative style by changes in the media landscape has an obvious urgency today. Based on contributions to a conference held in Innsbruck in February 2016--four months before the Brexit referendum, nine months before Donald Trump's election, and more than a year before the elections which would see the installation of a new Austrian black-blue coalition headed by Sebastian Kurz and Heinz-Christian Strache--the various chapters were conceived before many of the prominent markers of an ascendant right-wing populism which popular press and academic observers alike have sought to connect to media upheaval. But not prescient, timely. Refugees.

Work into above... Graf on advantages and difficulties that naturally arise with such a volume (myriad approaches-vibrant mixture, Innsbruck overrepped)

Schröder's introductory essay "Medienkommunikation im Wandel" provides a framework for the volume, introducing three rubrics of medial change, what he calls "Metatrends des Medienwandels" (13): the increasing prevalence of imagery (*bilderflut*)
