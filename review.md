# Lisa Blasch, Daniel Pfurtscheller, Thomas Schröder, eds. *Schneller,  bunter, leichter? Kommunikationsstile im medialen Wandel* Innsbrucker Beiträge zur Kulturwissenschaft, Germanistische Reihe 88. Innsbruck: Innsbruck UP, 2018. 369 pp.

A volume addressing the changes wrought in communicative style by changes in the media landscape has an obvious urgency today. Based on contributions to a conference held in Innsbruck in February 2016--four months before the Brexit referendum, nine months before Donald Trump's election, and more than a year before the election of a new Austrian black-blue coalition--the various chapters were conceived before many of the markers of an ascendant right-wing populism which popular press and academic observers alike have sought to connect to media upheaval. The essays assembled here offer careful documentation and contextualization of these trends that have recently exploded into mainstream discourse.

Schröder's introductory essay "Medienkommunikation im Wandel" provides a framework for the volume, introducing three rubrics of medial change, or "Metatrends des Medienwandels:" the changing relationship of word and image (*Bilderflut*); the increasingly active role of the recipient; and the problematic results of a shift towards the wishes of that recipient (*Boulevardisierung*) (13). While all of these changes might be associated with the rise of the world wide web, Schröder traces their origins to the mid-1980s, showing how newspaper and television had already begun to demonstrate these trends before the web would radicalize them.

After this introductory chapter, the book is divided into three sections, although the heterogeneous essays in the first section "Metatrends des Wandels" already explode any organizational framework this suggests, not to mention any guiding sense given by Schröders essay. Two essays reach far beyond the opener's time frame. First, Michael Klemm's engaging discussion of *Jahresrückblicke* as medial figures of memory (Assman) stretches across the history of these programs in the ARD from 1952 to the present, offering an intriguing "kleine multimodale Kultur- und Diskursgeschichte der Bundesrepublik" (53). Konstantin Niehaus's chapter, which discusses language and style in German-language newspapers of the 18th and 19th centuries explodes the time scale still further. Like Lisa Blasch's chapter which follows, it challenges the simplification of a concept like *Boulevardisierung*. Where Niehaus takes on ideas about an increasingly colloquialized and therefore dumbed-down language in post-war newspapers, countering the uninformed assumption that older newspapers had not featured such language, Blasch discusses the prevalence of human interest stories and celebrity narratives in contemporary media. Drawing on John Fiske's concept of the hyperreal figure, her suggestion that such "*hyperreal[e] Medienfiguren" might function as "textuelle Schauplätze öffentlicher Debatten" (112) calls to mind Robin Lakoff (cf *The Language War*)--an interlocutor unfortunately absent from this volume. The section features an equally wide range of methodologies, from applied linguistics in Aleksandra Gnach's chapter on virtual communities to a focus on narrative in Friederike Hermann's timely analysis of reporting on refugees, which focuses on criticism leveled at the ARD for *not* reporting on a refugee-related rape in Freiburg, an event which was immediately connected to the 2015 New Year's assaults in Cologne, even though they had little in common. Hermann notes the power of the narrative: "Hinter diesem machtvollen Narrativ, das vorherrschende Gefühle  aufgreift, verschwinden die Fakten. Sie werden vom Publikum nur aufgenommen und erhalten ihre Bedeutung, soweit sie in das dominante Narrativ passen" (45).

The second section, "Formate," is by far the largest, with seven (somewhat arbitrarily grouped) essays. Daniel Pfurtscheller's essay investigating the changes in the kid's quiz show "1, 2 oder 3" over 40 years shares much in common with Klemm's discussion of Jahresrückblicke. Similarly, Martha Kuhnhenn's analysis of the glyphosate debates is similar in its handling of contemporary controversies to Herrmann's  chapter. Three chapters handle online news: Tanjev Schultz investigates the "teaser" in digital news stories, marking out interesting trends like the "Von-Wegen-Teaser" (Alle Teaser sind originell? Von wegen" (199)) and showing how teasers can sensationalize, but can also guide users to more sophisticated content. Karl N. Renner's chapter handles the same object as Cordelia Wolf and Alexander Godulla's collaboration: multimedia long-form journalism. In spite of their rather different methodologies--Renner surveys different examples through the lens of communicative action, while Wolf and Godulla present an empirical analysis of reception--they share a cautious optimism: "Interaktive multimediale Online-Reportagen bieten optimale Voraussetzungen, den Journalismus bei der Wahrnehmung seiner gesellschaftlichen Aufgaben zu unterstützen" (Renner 147). The remaining two chapters from this section cross historical periods. Sylvia Jaki analyzes two English TV documentaries about Jack the Ripper, while Heike Ortner analyzes fitness instructions between 1913 and 2015. She notes the change from "Leibesübungen als Maßnahme zur Stärkung des 'Volkskörpers'" to exercise "als Weg zu Fitness, Schlankheit und Attraktivität" (250), but the focus of her engaging essay is not the ideological shifts, but rather the shifts in language and media.

Dennis Kaltwasser and Marianne Franz chapters in the third section fit well with its title, "Partizipative Potenziale," as both explore comments in online news sites. Franz's contribution will be of particular interest to Austriannists, as her examples are drawn from postings on the websites of *Der Standard* and *Die Krone* surrounding the notorious "bauliche Maßnahmen" during the height of the refugee crisis in 2015. Andreas Wiesinger's chapter also addresses online comments, specifically on the sites of German tabloids, and unlike the previous two chapters, he draws out the connections to Facebook and Twitter, addressing these two platforms more directly than any other chapter in the book. The final chapter is something of an outlier: Heiner Apel, Bernadette Rieder, and Cordula Schwarze take us to the Raetermuseum Hohe Birga near Innsbruck and analyze the tension between "Medien als Dienst am Exponat" and "Medien als Exponat" (360), a discussion which provides insight relevant to earlier essays as well, since media are never just the newspapers and websites we read, but are also an object of these. This final essay seems to contradict at least part of the assumption underlying the volume's title, for while *bunter* and *leichter* may accurately describe the media of the museum, museum texts depend on strategies of "Verlangsamung, der Einladung zum Verweilen sowie zur Vertiefung" (332).

Inspite of the somewhat arbitrary organization and the sorts of variations and inconsistencies that one often finds in such volumes, the essays presented here are highly engaging takes on different aspects of a very timely theme, and the volume is a welcome contribution to media studies scholarship.
