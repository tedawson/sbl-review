# Lisa Blasch, Daniel Pfurtscheller, Thomas Schröder, eds. *Schneller,  bunter, leichter? Kommunikationsstile im medialen Wandel* Innsbrucker Beiträge zur Kulturwissenschaft, Germanistische Reihe 88. Innsbruck: Innsbruck UP, 2018. 369 pp.

A volume addressing the changes wrought in communicative style by changes in the media landscape has an obvious urgency today. Based on contributions to a conference held in Innsbruck in February 2016--four months before the Brexit referendum, nine months before Donald Trump's election, and more than a year before the elections which would see the installation of a new Austrian black-blue coalition headed by Sebastian Kurz and Heinz-Christian Strache--the various chapters were conceived before many of the prominent markers of an ascendant right-wing populism which popular press and academic observers alike have sought to connect to media upheaval. But not prescient, timely. Refugees.

Schröder's introductory essay "Medienkommunikation im Wandel" provides a framework for the volume, introducing three rubrics of medial change, what he calls "Metatrends des Medienwandels" (13): the changing relationship of word and image (*Bilderflut*); the increasingly active role of the recipient; and the problematic results of a shift towards the wishes of that recipient (*Boulevardisierung*). While all of these changes might be associated with the rise of the world wide web, Schröder traces their origins to the mid-1980s, showing how newspaper and television had already begun to demonstrate these trends before the web would radicalize them. While it is disappointing that the essay does not mention radio--a medium which would complicate its arguments, making this lacuna understandable but also all the more frustrating--its value lies in the care given to tracing large scale trends across media, showing for instance how the shifts in newspaper formats towards short teasers on the front page or the rise after the 1984-85 allowance of private channels in Germany of the remote-control wielding television represent a more active recipient in ways that anticipate the web user.

After this introductory chapter, the book presents three sections. The first "Metatrends des Wandels" appears most directly connected to the opening, although where Schröder traced present trends to origins in the 1980s, we see here a still larger scale with Michale Klemm's fascinating ... followed by
