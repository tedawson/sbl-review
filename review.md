# Review of **Schneller,  bunter, leichter? Kommunikationsstile im medialen Wandel** Lisa Blasch, Daniel Pfurtscheller, Thomas Schr√∂der, eds.

A volume addressing the changes wrought in communicative style by changes in the media landscape has an obvious urgency today. Based on contributions to a conference held in Innsbruck in February 2016--four months before the Brexit referendum, nine months before Donald Trump's election, and more than a year before the elections which would see the installation of a new Austrian black-blue coalition headed by Sebastian Kurz and Heinz-Christian Strache--the various chapters were conceived before many of the prominent markers of an ascendant right-wing populism which popular press and academic observers alike have sought to connect to media upheaval. But not prescient, timely. Refugees.
